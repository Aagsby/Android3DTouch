# Android 3D Touch

I was pretty sure, I could recreate the iPhone 6s 3D Touch Implementation seen here -> https://github.com/freinbichler/3d-touch using the Touch objects sizeX and sizeY values.
Turns out, I was right. It might not be as accurate as Apples 3D Touch feature, but it is usable.

To test it, check it out under the following link using your Android device.

Tested using mobile Chrome and mobile Firefox.
It does not work in Stock Android browser and it seems to behave slightly different in Chrome and FF.

Also, it feels a bit "jerky", but it should be enough to differentiate between a soft and a strong touch.
